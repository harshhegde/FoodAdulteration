There has been an alarming increase in Formaldehyde contamination in the
Indian subcontinent in various edible products. Vegetables, fish, poultry and
dairy products are most aected by this and it poses a threat to the health
of the consumers. This thesis presents the complete design, implementation
and testing analysis of a formalin detection kit based on microcontrollers and
sensors.

As all volatile organic compounds such as formalin self-vaporise, the con-
centration of the VOC compound can be detected by sensing the presence
of VOC gas using a volatile organic compound (VOC) sensor. The output
signal from the gas sensor is fed to a microcontroller unit which converts
the electrical signal into a digital value. A complete kit using display, alarm
and sensor is implemented and tested and the results are validated by VOC
sample solutions prepared in a chemical laboratory at dierent concentration
levels.

Results show that detected levels of VOC compound are consistent with
VOC concentration used in samples. The system also displays the humidity
and the temperature of the given sample. The system gives out a sound
alarm when excessively high level of adulterant is detected in samples which
are regarded as dangerous for health. Additionally, comparative assessment
shows that the detection kit analyses the samples quantitatively as well as
qualitatively which makes our kit unique.
